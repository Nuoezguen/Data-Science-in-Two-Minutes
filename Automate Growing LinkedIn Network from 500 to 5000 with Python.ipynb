    "# Growing Your LinkedIn Network from 500 to 5000 with Python\n",
    "If you are reading this, you probably recieved a LinkedIn request from me within the last few days. The reason for this was because I started a the [Houston Data Science meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Science/) which will focus on teaching the theory and practice of data science and I wanted to attract new members.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways of increasing membership in my meetup was to head to LinkedIn and start inviting anyone with any 'data science' terms in their profile (which is quite a bit these days). After a few hundred manual key invites, I felt like smashing something to relieve the tension built up from the repetitive motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of resorting to breaking objects, I decided to let python rip apart LinkedIn for me. I recently did some automated web scraping with a wonderful python package, selenium. Selenium is an easy to use (like nearly every python package) and powerful tool that allows you to automate browser activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, I will show you how to...\n",
    "1. log into LinkedIn\n",
    "1. Enter text into input boxes\n",
    "1. Click buttons\n",
    "1. Select Options\n",
    "1. Handle edge cases\n",
