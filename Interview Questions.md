Many times these words are used interchangeably but generally they have different meanings
A model (or method or technique) can be a general idea of how to interpret

Examples: Linear regression is a model and least squares (or maximum likelihood) is the algorithm used to find the parameters in the model.
Neural Networks are a model with backpropagation
